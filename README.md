# Quit Bad Journalism

A Chrome extension built to block access to websites whose business model relies on bad, trashy or hateful journalism. Nominate more by emailing URLs to [quitbadjournalism@gmail.com](mailto:quitbadjournalism@gmail.com) or by submitting a pull-request.

Have other sites which you don't agree with? You can add custom URLs/RegExp through the extension's options.

Just so you don't get fully locked into some kind of echo chamber, there is a link to allow one to access the blocked page.


## Why?

Lots of businesses and websites big and small make their money by selling advertising space. It's important for them to produce and/or publish content that attracts viewers.

Some of these publishing entities exercise a significant lack of journalistic integrity — nee, even a disheartening absence of respect for the general public — and present a form of content as polluting and rotten as '80s [Troma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMGCPRJNKUg)-grade nuclear waste on society.

Obviously, each person to their own tastes. However, if you are an individual that wants to be a little more proactive in reducing the revenue these poor taste websites make, **Quit Bad Journalism** is a tool to catch and warn against the dangers of clickbait, tabloids, fake news and alternative facts.
